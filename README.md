"script_verify_requests.py" is a primitive web-crawler with the sole purpose to find  not working URL's that can be accessed from "https://data.gov.ro/". Using a GET request, the script extracts the package list from the JSON file received from "https://data.gov.ro/api/3/action/package_list", and iterates through each data_set. For each data_set, the crawler send another GET request, and then using a HEAD request, it checks if the URL in the data_set object is reachable. All failing URL's are logged along with their specific data_set in "failing_URLS.txt" file.
